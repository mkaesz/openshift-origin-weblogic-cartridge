# openshift-origin-weblogic-cartridge

This is an Openshift Cartridge providing Oracle Weblogic 12c. I created it during a workshop for a customer. I do NOT recommend to use it for anything else then learning and testing purposes. It does not include any Weblogic binaries. 

I recommend to look into the refactored version of the cartridge from my colleague JÃ¼rgen Hoffmann: https://github.com/juhoffma/openshift-origin-weblogic-cartridge
